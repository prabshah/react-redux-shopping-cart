## Earthquakes Record

## Instructions

### To run the app locally
1. Install dependencies - it might take a while (!)
    ```
    $ yarn/npm install
    ```    
5. Checkout to the application
    ```
    $ yarn/npm start
    ```  

## Approach

### Features
With the time given, I have chosen a combination of features and decided on how
the structure of the application should look like. I then followed agile development approach to develop the application.

With this application, users can:
- get the list of earthquakes that have happened between 2014-01-01 and 2014-01-02 on page load
- able to filter the list by magnitude
- able to filter the list by magnitude type.

### Main frameworks and libraries
- React, Redux, JavaScript, Bootstrap, reactstrap, HTML & CSS

### Application architecture
The frontend serves as an interface with the user. I aimed to achieve a simple yet
attractive design while keeping the user experience as the highest priority. 

### Possible Improvements
I am aware that I have not managed to write any test for the application due to time frame. If I had more time I would have written test to make sure React components and their integration is working as expected using Jest and Enzyme.
